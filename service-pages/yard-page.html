    <details class="faq-card-1">
      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>What’s included in your yard work services?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: Our yard work services cover all the essentials to keep your property neat, healthy, and enjoyable.
          This can include lawn mowing, edging along sidewalks and driveways, trimming shrubs, weeding garden beds,
          raking leaves, and removing debris or branches. We also offer seasonal services like spring and fall
          cleanups, aeration, power raking, and fertilizing to keep your lawn strong throughout Lethbridge’s changing
          seasons. Every visit is tailored to your yard’s needs, and we always haul away yard waste so you’re left
          with a clean, fresh outdoor space.

      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>Can you haul away old debris, branches, or junk from my yard?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: Yes — we provide hauling and removal services for yard waste such as branches, leaves, grass clippings,
          and general debris. If you’re cleaning up after a storm, trimming trees, or tackling an overgrown yard,
          we’ll make sure everything is collected and properly disposed of. For non-organic items like old fencing,
          garden materials, or light outdoor junk, we can often remove those too — just let us know ahead of time.
          Our goal is to leave your yard looking clean, clear, and ready to enjoy without you having to deal with
          the mess.

    <details class="faq-card-1">
      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>How often should my lawn be aerated?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: In Lethbridge, most lawns benefit from aeration once a year, usually in the spring or fall.
          Aeration relieves soil compaction, improves water and nutrient absorption, and helps roots grow
          deeper — which is especially important in our region’s heavy clay soils and dry climate. If your lawn
          gets a lot of foot traffic or shows signs of thinning and poor drainage, you may benefit from aerating
          twice a year. Regular aeration keeps your lawn healthier, greener, and better prepared for both hot summers
          and chinook temperature swings.

    <details class="faq-card-1">
      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>What does a typical spring yard cleanup include?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: A spring cleanup is all about giving your yard a fresh start after winter. Our service usually includes
          raking up leftover leaves and debris, power raking or dethatching the lawn to remove dead grass, edging
          along sidewalks and garden beds, pruning shrubs and trees as needed, and preparing flower beds for planting.
          We can also aerate and fertilize your lawn to encourage strong growth early in the season. In Lethbridge,
          spring yard cleanups are especially important to recover from chinook winds, snow compaction, and dry
          conditions — helping your lawn and garden bounce back quickly.

    <details class="faq-card-1">
      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>Do you clean gutters as part of yard maintenance?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: Yes — gutter cleaning can be added to your yard maintenance service. Keeping gutters clear of leaves,
          twigs, and debris is important to prevent water damage, foundation issues, and overflow into your yard.
          We carefully remove all buildup, flush out downspouts if needed, and ensure your gutters are draining
          properly. Since Lethbridge often gets strong winds that blow debris into gutters, regular cleaning
          (usually in spring and fall) is highly recommended.

      <summary class="faq-label-1">
        <i class="fas fa-arrow-right-long"></i>Do you remove and haul away all yard waste?
      </summary>
      <div class="faq-content-1">
        <p>
          A: Yes — all of our yard work services include cleanup and hauling of debris. Whether it’s grass clippings,
          leaves, branches, or other organic waste, we make sure your property is left clean and ready to enjoy.
          For larger projects, such as heavy pruning or dump runs, we arrange bulk hauling so you don’t
          have to worry about disposal. Our goal is to handle the dirty work from start to finish, so you don’t have
          to lift a finger.
